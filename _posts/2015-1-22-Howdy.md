title: About Me
---

Howdy! My name is Hector. I am from Sheridan, Wyoming, USA. I have a BS in Chemical Engineering and I have spent the past two years working for an Environmental Consulting company. I am currently studying to become a web/software developer. Playing soccer and listening to Johnny Cash makes me very happy.
