title: Rocky Mountain High to West Coast Low

For now, this post will remain unfinished as I have a lot on my plate at the moment, but I will outline the major point.

I recently relocated to Seattle, Washington, from Sheridan, Wyoming. If you have read my About section, you know I love to play soccer,
and I play as often as my beat up knees will allow. I have started to play pick up games here in Seattle on a regular basis, and it has
been somewhat of a surprise for me to discover that I am not getting winded everytime I make a length-of-the-field run. This is undoubtedly
attributed to the fact that in Sheridan, WY the elevation is about ~3800 ft. whereas the elevation in Seattle, WA is about ~300 ft.

To be continued...
