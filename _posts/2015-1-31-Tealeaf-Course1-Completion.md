title: Graduation day from Tealeaf Academy Course 1 of 3
---

Today is graduation day. I have completed course 1 of 3 of Tealeaf Academy's Ruby on Rails online coding bootcamp. 
Factoring in the week it took me to complete the precourse work, it took me about 2 months, working at a pace of about 20 hours 
a week to complete the course. This is longer than I anticipated, but that is totally okay with me. I would rather spend 
additional time to get a better grasp of things, rather than move on prematurely. There are certain things that are still a 
bit fuzzy (primarily OOP/AJAX/jQuery) but as Chris mentioned at the beginning of the course, becoming a master programmer is a 
circular learning process. You might get that ah-ha moment the third or fourth time around. Overall, I am very happy with how much I 
have learned. I am very happy with the course content and the way it is presented. The guys/gals? at Tealeaf Academy are doing an awesome job. 
I am also taking a Rails course at the University of Washington, and the instructor directed us to Tealeaf Academy's open book shelf 
in case we needed a Ruby refresher, so you know Tealeaf is doing something right.

My recommendation would be to lengthen the OOP section with additional exercises. I believe that was the most dense section of Course 1 
and I think it would be good to get more practice with it.

See you all in Course 2!!!
